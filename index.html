                    Gender equality and mainstreaming has received significant constitutional
                    attention in Kenya. We are an equal opportunities employer and strive to ensure
                    that there is equal treatment of all our employees. We also strive to ensure
                    adequate remuneration for the services rendered (equal pay for equal job
                    principle). Further, SARUMBO VENTURES LIMITED ensures gender equality is
                    upheld at all levels of its operations, including during the hiring of experts and
                    consultants.
                <br>
                Noting that gender equality is both an important international development and
                crosscutting priority, we strive to ensure that:

                    <li>Identify gender equality issues. This may include obstacles which different gender groups in the client organization may face in the management of its operations. If there are no constraints, the analysis will demonstrate this</li>
                    <li>Select the gender equality issues that require attention and advise management on the best way to address the same</li>
                    <li>Work with the client management staff to develop a strategy to address the issues raised and overcome constraints</li>
